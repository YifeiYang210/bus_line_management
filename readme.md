## Introduction

This project focuses on creating robust data validation and analysis tools for bus line management, encompassing complex data consistency analysis.

You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation! In this project, you will write your own programs to test data consistency and correctness. You will practice reading documentation, working with data in JSON format, and creating lists, iterators, and dictionaries. You will also learn how to work with set methods, the itertools library, and the regular expression library.


## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:
1. Checking the data type. Check that the types of variables match and all the required fields are filled.
2. Correct Syntax. Check if the syntax is correct. This is a good opportunity to use the ''re'' library.
3. Bus line info. Make sure that the information about the bus lines and the number of stops is correct.
4. Special Stops. Find all departure stations, final stops, and transfer stops to fill in the missing specifications.
5. Unlost in time. Make sure that the stops follow each other and their estimated arrival times make sense.
6. On-demand. Check that there are no wrongly marked on-demand stops.

Other features will be coming soon!
